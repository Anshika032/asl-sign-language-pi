# ðŸ¤Ÿ ASL Recognition on Raspberry Pi

This project demonstrates **real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition** using a CNN model deployed on a **Raspberry Pi 5**. The model is converted to **TensorFlow Lite** for fast edge inference.  

The system captures video, recognizes ASL hand gestures, maps them to text, builds words, and converts them into speech using **gTTS**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-time ASL alphabet recognition (Aâ€“Z)  
- Word building with **SPACE** and **DEL**  
- Speech output with **gTTS + mpg123**  
- Runs fully on Raspberry Pi  

---

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt

# Run the demo
python3 finalfinal.py
